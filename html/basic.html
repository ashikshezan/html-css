            <div>
                <p>
                    To set a different font on your text, you use the <a
                        href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family"><code>font-family</code></a> property — this allows you
                    to
                    specify a font (or list of fonts) for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser
                    will
                    only apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on; if not, it
                    will
                    just use a browser <a href="#default_fonts">default font</a>. A simple example looks like so:
                </p>
                <P>Speaking of font availability, there are only a certain number of fonts that are generally available
                    across
                    all systems and can therefore be used without much worry. These are the so-called web safe fonts.
                </P>
                <h3>Web safe fonts</h3>
                <P>
                    Most of the time, as web developers we want to have more specific control over the fonts used to
                    display
                    our
                    text content. The problem is to find a way to know which font is available on the computer used to
                    see
                    our
                    web pages. There is no way to know this in every case, but the web safe fonts are known to be
                    available
                    on
                    nearly all instances of the most used operating systems (Windows, macOS, the most common Linux
                    distributions, Android, and iOS).
                </P>
                <P>
                    The list of actual web safe fonts will change as operating systems evolve, but it's reasonable to
                    consider
                    the following fonts web safe, at least for now (many of them have been popularized thanks to the
                    Microsoft
                    Core fonts for the Web initiative in the late 90s and early 2000s)

                <h3>Default fonts</h3>
                <p>
                    CSS defines five generic names for fonts: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy. Those
                    are very generic and the exact font face used when using those generic names is up to each browser
                    and can vary for each operating system they are running on. It represents a worst case scenario
                    where the browser will try to do its best to provide at least a font that looks appropriate. serif,
                    sans-serif and monospace are quite predictable and should provide something reasonable. On the other
                    hand, cursive and fantasy are less predictable and we recommend using them very carefully, testing
                    as you go.

            <h2>Project Initial CSS Practice</h2>
            <div>
                <p>You have been provided with some raw HTML for the homepage of an imaginary community college, plus
                    some CSS that styles the page into a three column layout and provides some other rudimentary
                    styling. You are to write your CSS additions below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file, to
                    make sure it is easy to mark the bits you have done. Don't worry if some of the selectors are
                    repetitious; we'll let you off in this instance.</p>
                <p>Fonts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First of all, download a couple of free-to-use fonts. Because this is a college, the fonts
                        should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, formal, trustworthy feel — a serif site-wide
                        font for the general text body, coupled with sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be
                        nice.</li>
                    <li>Use a suitable service to generate bulletproof <code>@font-face</code> code for these two fonts.
                    </li>
                    <li>Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your headings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>General text styling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give the page a site-wide <code>font-size</code> of <code>10px</code>.</li>
                    <li>Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined using a suitable
                        relative unit.</li>
                    <li>Give your body text a suitable <code>line-height</code>.</li>
                    <li>Center your top level heading on the page.</li>
                    <li>Give your headings a little bit of <code>letter-spacing</code> to make them not too squashed,
                        and allow the letters to breathe a bit.</li>
                    <li>Give your body text some <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>word-spacing</code>, as
                        appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Give the first paragraph after each heading in the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> a little bit of
                        text-indentation, say 20px.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Links:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give the link, visited, focus, and hover states some colors that go with the color of the
                        horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.</li>
                    <li>Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them, the underline
                        disappears.</li>
                    <li>Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.</li>
                    <li>Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out nicely, but make it still
                        fit in with the overall page design.</li>
                    <li>Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lists:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall
                        page. Each list item should have the same <code>line-height</code> as a paragraph line, and each
                        list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.</li>
                    <li>Give your list items a nice bullet, appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you
                        whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Navigation menu:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Style your navigation menu so that it has an appropriate look for the look and feel for the
                        page.</li>
